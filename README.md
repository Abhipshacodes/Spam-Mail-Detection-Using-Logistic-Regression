- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords, etc.)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression model for classification
- Accuracy evaluation 
- User input testing

ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualization)
- Google Collab and Python Script

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The model uses the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) from UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains 5,574 labeled messages.
